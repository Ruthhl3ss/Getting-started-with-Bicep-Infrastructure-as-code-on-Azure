## Book Description
Infrastructure as Code is crucial to becoming successful in the Azure Cloud. Azure Resource Manager allows you to create resources in Azure in a declarative way. For many years we have been using ARM Templates to declare resources in a JSON format. Although ARM Templates are very powerful, the implementation of the JSON language is hard to read, maintain and debug. Bicep, a Domain Specific Language, overcomes these issues by providing a transparent abstraction layer on top of ARM and ARM Templates. This significantly improves the authoring experience. Bicep is easy to understand at a glance and straightforward to learn regardless of your experience with other programming languages.
The book starts with some history and background in infrastructure as code and ARM Templates. It continues by explaining Bicep and providing guidance on how to get started.
As part of the syntax chapter, you will start jour journey by understanding the syntax of Bicep. You will start by learning the basics first and you will gradually dive deeper in the more advanced scenarios.
The book also contains a dedicated chapter on a big real-world example which provides you with great insights on how to leverage Bicep for production usage.
Also part of this book is the Bicep playground, visualizer and a PowerShell module for Bicep provided by the community.
